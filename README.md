Dependencies:
1. nodejs
2. npm (installed with node)

To set up:
1. `git clone https://github.com/kauffmanes/isd-course-eval.git`
2. `cd isd-course-eval`
3. `npm install`
4. `cd www`
5. `npm install`

To start server and build UI:
1. `cd ..`
2. `node app`
3. Open a new terminal window in same directory
4. `cd www`
5. `npm run build`
6. Open a browser such as Chrome or FF and go to `http://localhost:3000`

In theory, it should show the UI
